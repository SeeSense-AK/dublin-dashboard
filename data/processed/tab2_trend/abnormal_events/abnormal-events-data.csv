1,O'Connell Bridge Junction (South),Abnormal cycling events have shown a steady increase at the south approach to O’Connell Bridge throughout the summer of 2025.,"Notable spikes were recorded in the August–September period, with an abnormal events rate rise of approximately 40% compared to early summer.","1. This junction is a critical multimodal hub featuring heavy bus, taxi, and cycling flows, as well as pedestrian movements. The inherent complexity of these overlapping transport modes likely contributes to the increased cyclist risk.
2. Rerouted public transport and increased buses, as part of ongoing initiatives to prioritize sustainable transport modes, have changed traffic patterns and introduced new challenges for cyclists in navigating the junction safely.
3. Recurring events such as public gatherings, festivals, and peak travel demand during the summer months may also create unpredictable traffic conditions, exacerbating risk for vulnerable road users.",Red
2,Merrion Square West / Merrion Square North Junction,"The Merrion Square area has experienced a marked increase in abnormal events, notably since mid-August 2025, correlating with sustained detours due to road improvements on Merrion Street Lower and utility works near the Dáil complex.","Several weeks exceeded typical incident thresholds, especially during wet conditions.","1. The period saw crowding during public events and increased traffic demand, leading to tighter road space and more sudden maneuvers by cyclists to navigate around obstacles or pedestrians.
2. While no major new road closures or infrastructure projects directly affected Merrion Square West/North in this window, routing changes to accommodate large scale events like the Dublin Pride parade (late June 2025) and other festivals could have contributed to periodic congestion and conflict.
3. Perception reports indicated increasing frustration with mixed traffic environments and limited dedicated cycling lanes in these junctions, which may have encouraged more defensive cycling behaviors such as hard braking or swerving.",Red
3,Herbert Place / Lower Baggot Street Junction,This junction’s deterioration appears linked to surface conditions and constrained geometry during and immediately after nearby maintenance. Follow-up surface quality assessments are recommended to verify whether the issue persists under dry conditions.,"Between August and September 2025, cyclist incident rates rose by approximately 60%, primarily driven by hard-brake and rough road surface detections.","1. The junction operates as a busy multi-modal node with significant pedestrian and bus flows intersecting cycle routes, creating complex traffic dynamics.
2. Ongoing minor utility work and infrastructure maintenance activities may have induced temporary narrowing of cycle lane space, increasing exposure to vehicular conflicts.
3. Perception reports highlight increased concerns about unclear lane demarcations and temporary signage unfamiliarity, which may contribute to increases in swerving or braking to avoid hazards.",Red
4,Pearse Street,"Pearse Street remains one of Dublin’s busiest east–west cycling corridors and recorded a sharp increase in abnormal events between June and August 2025. Deteriorations were most pronounced near the Sandwith Street junction, where braking and swerve clusters rose by more than 70%.",Pearse Street has experienced a notable 45% increase in braking and road roughness-related abnormal cycling events.,"1. Pearse Street functions as a central urban artery, intersecting with multiple bus routes, local delivery activity, and substantial pedestrian volumes throughout the summer.
2. Bus stop realignment works and lane marking revisions completed in early July temporarily reduced cyclist buffer space.
3. The site’s particular mix of through traffic, cyclist density, and ongoing citywide travel adaptations may be generating new conflict points or exacerbating small defects in the riding surface.",Red
5,Bridge Street,"This junction has seen a sharp increase in near-miss abnormal events, particularly in July and August 2025, coinciding with BusConnects construction detours and major bus re-routing.","The spike was most pronounced in late August, coinciding with resurfacing and service duct works nearby on Barrow Street and Forbes Street, which likely redirected local traffic through the Ringsend corridor.","1. Narrow approach lanes over Ringsend Bridge and limited visibility when merging from Fitzwilliam Quay.
2. Surface transitions between the bridge deck and adjoining road sections, producing minor bumps that trigger braking and swerve events.
3. Perception reports described “sharp ridges near the bridge joints” and “tight passes from turning vehicles exiting Fitzwilliam Quay.”",Red
6,O'Connell Street/Abbey Street Junction,"The data reflects successful post-works stabilization of the O’Connell Street junction. Improvements are likely due to the removal of temporary barriers, signal retiming, and reduced construction-related obstructions — collectively restoring safe and predictable cyclist behavior in the city core.","Cycling conditions at the O’Connell Street and Abbey Street junction showed a steady improvement from June onward, with a 40% reduction in hard-brake and swerve events by early September.","1. Completion of the Earl Place / Sackville Place logistics works (ended 19 July 2025) reduced temporary vehicle lane encroachments on cycle routes.
2. Recalibration of pedestrian and cycle signals in early August improved junction flow timing.
3. Cyclist perception reports shifted positively, describing the junction as “less confusing and more predictable” after the new signal phases were introduced.",Green
7,Barrow Street,The reduction in event frequency along Barrow Street demonstrates the positive effect of surface renewal and signal optimization. It highlights how small geometric and surfacing interventions can yield measurable safety improvements in high-volume commuter corridors.,"Braking and swerving events along Barrow Street decreased by over 21% between July and September 2025, marking one of the clearest positive changes across the Docklands network.","1. DCC and SIRO resurfacing works (20–21 May 2025) on Grand Canal Street and Barrow Street improved traction and lane evenness.
2. Following the Forbes Street junction upgrade (completed late May), signal sequencing became smoother, reducing mid-turn conflict points.",Green
8,Eden Quay,"Eden Quay’s event rate improvement indicates effective post-maintenance recovery of surface quality and junction discipline. This section of the north quays now shows reduced reactive braking and improved ride consistency, aligning with broader efforts to stabilize traffic patterns post–bridge works.","Between June and September 2025, Eden Quay recorded a steady decline in braking and swerve anomalies, improving by approximately 35%.
The most significant improvement occurred from late July onward, following completion of quay-side resurfacing and bus-stop reconfiguration.","1. Utility trench reinstatement and surface levelling (completed mid-July 2025) eliminated the uneven patches that previously contributed to pothole detections.
2. Completion and opening of Royal Canal Greenway Phase 3 (mid-2025) provided high-quality cycle and pedestrian paths along Eden Quay.
3. Cyclists in late August perception logs reported that “the surface feels smoother and the buses are easier to anticipate.”",Green
9,College Green Junction,College Green’s marked improvement reflects the combined benefit of signal recalibration and reduced detour pressure after the reopening of nearby works. The junction has transitioned from a congestion-induced hotspot to a more predictable and safer node for cyclists navigating central Dublin.,Abnormal events at College Green dropped by roughly 45% between August and September 2025.,"1. Signal optimization trials conducted in early July improved timing for combined bus and cycle movements entering Dame Street.
2. Removal of temporary bus diversions linked to the Castle Street reconstruction (ended 18 August 2025) relieved the junction of excess load.
3. Cyclist sentiment shifted noticeably, with several riders describing the junction as “less chaotic and easier to read.”",Green
