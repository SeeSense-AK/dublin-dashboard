Its sustained popularity points to a mature cycling culture in the surrounding area and reinforces the need for proactive infrastructure maintenance and surface improvements to support increasing use on this key suburban route.",,Green
4,Ranelagh,12 May 2025,"Cycling in Ranelagh surged despite adverse weather, revealing that commuter habits are resilient to moderate disruptions.","Weekly cycling trips on Ranelagh Road averaged 276 from May to June, with a high of 335 trips recorded in the week of June 23rd.","Ranelagh continues to emerge as one of Dublin’s key inner-south cycling corridors, showing sustained growth and resilience in usage. Cyclist volumes increased sharply by 75% in May and a further 70% in June, demonstrating strong commuter reliance and an expanding base of regular riders. The June spike may partly reflect temporary traffic redistribution following road closures on Rathgar Road, which likely diverted some commuter flow through Ranelagh. The 21% variance between average and peak counts suggests steady week-to-week growth rather than sporadic surges, reflecting a route gaining traction as a preferred connector into the city centre. Its central location and consistent popularity point to mounting pressure on existing infrastructure, highlighting the need for early interventions such as improved junction design, traffic calming, and dedicated cycle priority measures to accommodate future demand safely and efficiently.",,Green
5,North Circular Road,05 May 2025,"Cyclist behaviour on North Circular Road shows that weather played a limited role in influencing volumes. Even amid periods of rain and overcast conditions, usage climbed steadily, indicating strong commuter dependency and adaptability once road access returned to normal.","Weekly cycling volume on North Circular Road averaged 180 trips, fluctuating between a peak of 308 and a low of 74 trips.","North Circular Road demonstrates a strong recovery in cycling activity following an early May decline of 45%, likely linked to road works that began mid-month. By late July, cyclist volumes had surged by 71%, even under poor weather conditions, indicating the route’s enduring role as a key link between Drumcondra and the city’s inner districts. The parallel drop on Drumcondra Road Lower supports the view that detours and temporary access changes temporarily displaced riders. Once restored, usage rebounded quickly, underscoring both the corridor’s importance for connectivity and its resilience to short-term infrastructure disruptions. Maintaining consistent surface quality and minimizing construction-related access barriers will be essential to sustaining its growing commuter use.",,Red
6,Rathgar Road,30 Jun 2025,"Despite periods of rain and strong winds, cycling activity rose notably in late May, showing the corridor’s strength as a commuter route. The sharp decline observed in late June was less weather-related and more directly linked to road works and partial closures, which continued until early July.","Cycling volume on Rathgar Road averaged 161 weekly trips, ranging from a low of 72 to a peak of 252 trips.","Rathgar Road remains a key south-central corridor within Dublin’s cycling network, recording a 43 percent rise in usage in late May despite adverse weather. The subsequent 70 percent decline in late June aligns with road works that limited access until early July. The concurrent rise in activity on nearby Ranelagh Road indicates that much of the traffic was temporarily diverted rather than displaced. With the completion of works, cyclist volumes recovered, reaffirming Rathgar Road’s importance as a well-used commuter link that benefits from consistent surface maintenance and reliable access management.",,Red
7,Alfie Byrne Road,19 May 2025,"The sharp decline in cycling activity coincided with periods of rain and overcast conditions, although weather appeared to be only a partial factor.","Cycling volume averaged 156 weekly trips, but was severely reduced to just 34 trips during a disruption week.","Alfie Byrne Road recorded a substantial reduction in cyclist volumes in mid-May, with numbers falling by 78 percent to 34 trips during the week when road works commenced. While adverse weather contributed to lower activity levels, the decline was primarily driven by infrastructure works that limited route accessibility. Given its strategic position connecting the coastal cycleway with Clontarf and East Wall, the disruption represented a temporary interruption in an otherwise well-used commuter route. Following the completion of works later in the summer, cyclist volumes began to stabilise, reaffirming Alfie Byrne Road’s role as a key component of Dublin’s eastern cycling network.",,Red
8,Blessington Street,8 Sep 2025,"The 61% decline in cycling occurred under mild, partially cloudy conditions, ruling out weather as the primary factor.","Cyclist volume saw a sharp 61% decline from first week of September, dropping from 98 to 39 trips per week.","Blessington Street served as a key north-side diversion corridor during the Castle Street and Cork Hill closures between April and August 2025. Cyclist volumes rose sharply through this period as north–south movements were redirected via Wellington Quay, Dame Street, and Crow Street, drawing commuters toward the D7 corridor. Additional resurfacing works on nearby Broadstone Avenue in early July further intensified activity along Blessington Street. Following the reopening of Castle Street on 18 August, cyclist volumes declined by 61 percent over the subsequent five weeks, reflecting a normalization of traffic rather than a loss of usage. The trend highlights the interdependence of city-centre roadworks and cycling flows, illustrating how temporary closures in one area can redistribute demand across the broader network.",,Red
9,Seville Place,11 Aug 2025,Rain consistently correlates with both safety deteriorations (swerve and surface roughness events) and volume declines.,"Seville Place reached its peak volume of 107 trips in the week of May 26th, but experienced a sharp 50% decline to 53 trips per week by mid-August.","Seville Place experienced a gradual reduction in cycling activity toward the end of August 2025, following a steady period of use earlier in the summer. The available data does not point to a single event or closure directly responsible for this change, and no major construction works were recorded on the street itself during that time. The decline may reflect a combination of seasonal commuting shifts, changing route preferences, or local traffic conditions rather than a specific diversion effect. While the pattern aligns with broader network adjustments observed across Dublin in late summer, the underlying cause remains unclear. Further investigation—such as cross-referencing local travel surveys or additional sensor data—would help determine whether this represents a temporary fluctuation or an emerging long-term trend.",,Red
10,Kill Lane,23 Jun 2025,Strong winds coincided with a significant 68% decrease in cycling volume on Kill Lane during the week of June 23rd.,Kill Lane's cycling volume peaked at 121 trips before declining to 39 trips during the windy week of June 23rd.,"Kill Lane showed a moderate but sustained decline in cyclist volumes during August 2025, following a period of consistent usage earlier in the year. No major roadworks or diversions were recorded along the corridor during this period, suggesting that the change was not directly linked to infrastructure activity. The reduction may instead reflect seasonal variation, changes in commuter travel patterns, or shifts toward alternative parallel routes such as Deansgrange Road or Clonkeen Road. As Kill Lane serves both residential and through-commuter functions, fluctuations in cycling activity can occur in response to broader mobility or weather factors. While the cause of the August decline remains uncertain, the pattern warrants further observation to determine whether it indicates a short-term adjustment or a longer-term change in route preference.",,Red
11,Mercer Street & Cuffe Street,15 Sep 2025,"Across both Cuffe Street and Mercer Street, periods of rain and strong winds consistently coincide with significant decreases in cyclist volume and deteriorations in safety metrics like swerve rates.","Peak volume of 102 trips coincided with mild weather, while its lowest volume occurred during severe wind and rain.","Mercer Street and Cuffe Street functioned as an essential central link during the Castle Street closure between April and August 2025, absorbing redirected traffic from the Dame Street corridor. Cyclist volumes increased throughout the closure as the route served as a primary north–south connection through the city centre. During late June and early July, bus stop installation and pavement works along Cuffe Street and Mercer Street Upper temporarily intensified congestion but maintained high cycling activity. Once Castle Street reopened on 18 August, cyclist volumes on both streets declined by 59 percent by mid-September, marking a rebalancing of movement across the network. ",,Red
12,Northumberland Road,25 Aug 2025,Periods of rain and wind on Northumberland Road consistently coincided with both significant decreases in cyclist volume and deteriorations in key safety metrics like hard-braking and road roughness reports.,"Northumberland Road reached its peak volume of 112 cyclists on April 28th, coinciding with mild and partially cloudy weather conditions.","Northumberland Road experienced a surge in cycling activity during the summer of 2025, acting as a preferred approach route from the Ballsbridge and Merrion areas while access through central corridors was restricted. Partial footpath and lane closures along Mount Street Lower, Holles Row, and Grattan Street between May and August further concentrated commuter movement onto Northumberland Road. Immediately after the reopening of Castle Street and the completion of works around Merrion Square, cyclist volumes fell by 70 percent within a week. This sharp decrease signified a rapid normalization of travel patterns rather than a loss of interest in the route. ",,Red
